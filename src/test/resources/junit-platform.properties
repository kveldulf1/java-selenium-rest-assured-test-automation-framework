# Enable parallel test execution
# Options: true (enable), false (disable)
# Recommendation: Enable for faster test execution if tests are independent
junit.jupiter.execution.parallel.enabled=true

# Default mode for methods within a test class - runs in same thread
# Options: same_thread (methods run in the same thread), concurrent (methods run in parallel)
# Recommendation: Use same_thread if methods have shared state; otherwise, consider concurrent
junit.jupiter.execution.parallel.mode.default=same_thread

# Default mode for test classes - runs concurrently
# Options: same_thread (classes run in the same thread), concurrent (classes run in parallel)
# Recommendation: Use concurrent to maximize parallelism if classes are independent
junit.jupiter.execution.parallel.mode.classes.default=concurrent

# Use fixed thread pool strategy for parallel execution
# Options: fixed (fixed number of threads), dynamic (threads based on available processors)
# Recommendation: Use fixed for predictable resource usage; dynamic for flexibility
junit.jupiter.execution.parallel.config.strategy=fixed

# Set number of concurrent threads (max number of tests that can run at the same time)
# Recommendation: Set based on your system's capabilities; too high may cause resource contention
